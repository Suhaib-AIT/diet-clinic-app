# Diet Clinic Management System

This monorepo contains a FastAPI backend and a React portal for managing a diet clinic.

## Quick Start

```bash
make dev-up
```

This command builds the Docker containers and starts the backend, frontend and database.

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Laravel Application

A Laravel 11 skeleton is available in the `laravel/` directory. It demonstrates a basic structure for role-based dashboards for Admin, Doctor, and Patient along with migrations and routes.
